CIS 1051 Final Game  
This is my visual novel based on my favorite video game, Fallout: New Vegas.  
It was created as my final project for my CIS 1051 Intro to Python class. I made this entirely in Renpy.  

I found Renpy very easy to use for the purpose of this visual novel. It has some different syntax than Python so I had to get used to that, but overall it was very straightforward.
The most difficult thing was finding quality free assets to use for my game. I ended up having to spend money on some assets because I didn't feel like the free assets fit my game well.

Credits for the assets that I used:
